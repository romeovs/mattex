keywords: matlab, siunitx, SI
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This package provides several macros that make it easier to save
and recall numerical variables, that have a value, an error and 
an exponent (e.g. 123 +- 45 e 6) in a TeX document. 

Macro's are supplied for quick access to these variables an to typeset them 
according to the SI norms (using siuntix).

There is also a set of matlab m-files that allow you to export variables
from matlab in a format that is readable by TeX (using this package), with 
the correct number of significant digits. 

This makes it very easy to export the variables from matlab to an intermediary
file, import them in TeX and use their values. 

Also, there are matlab functions supplied to export an array and there are TeX
macros that allow for typesetting these in a quick fashion.

This project is now up on GitHub, so you can contribute if you feel you want to!

The package is supplied in .sty format. It requires the following packages
to operate:

 - pgfkeys
 - xstring
 - siuntixs
 - xparse
 - array
 - collcell

TODO:
----

(*) update manual to reflect recent (big) changes in the mfiles.
(*) fix makematrix and collcell clash

Release Notes:
-------------

Not released on CTAN (yet)!
This is a test version. Note that the project is still undergoing some big changes, 
so usage might still change. 

- added parsemopts.m for generalized options parsing
